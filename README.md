# bankingstandalone
These are standalone files that I need to use to create a banking app. I need to "nxp create-react-app ." in new folder and integrate these standalone files with the create-react-app files. I think the problem im having is with the routing, but I am not sure. I am using node, express, cors, mongodb, react.
